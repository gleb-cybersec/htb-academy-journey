# Common Network Protocols

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Used for delivering web content: operates at the Application layer of the OSI model, connecting the user's browser to the web server

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
This protocol is responsible for transferring files between computers. Operating at the Application layer, it allows users to upload files to a server or download them from there.

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
This protocol handles the sending of email. Operating at the Application layer, it is responsible for transferring messages between servers so that they reach the intended recipients.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
This protocol guarantees reliable data transmission by checking for errors and recovering lost fragments. Operating at the Transport layer, it first establishes a connection between the sender and receiver, and then delivers the data in the correct sequence.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
A Transport layer protocol that sacrifices reliability for speed. It simply sends data into the network (connectionless), without concerning itself with errors or losses, which is why it is so popular in streaming video systems and online games.

## IP (Internet Protocol)
This protocol is responsible for routing packets between different networks. Operating at the Internet Layer, it assigns addresses to packets and determines their path from the sender to the receiver through multiple intermediate networks.
