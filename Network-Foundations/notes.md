## Network
   A network is a group of interconnected devices that can exchange data and share resources.
   
   - Key concepts:
     - ***Nodes*** are individual devices connected to the network.
     - ***Communication*** channels are the data transmission paths that connect network nodes (wired or wireless).
     - ***Data Sharing*** is the key purpose of a network, allowing devices to exchange information with each other.

  - Benefits:
    - ***Resource sharing***
    - ***Communication***
    - ***Access to data from any connected device***
    - ***Collaboration even from a distance***

  - Types:
    - **Local Area Network (LAN)** - connects devices over a short distance
      - Сharacteristics:
          - 1. Covers a small area;
          - 2. Belongs to one person or one organization
          - 3. High data transfer speed
          - 4. Uses wired or wireless connections.
    - **Wide Area Network (WAN)** - connects multiple LANs
        - Characteristic:
          - 1. Covers a lager area;
          - 2. Collective or distributed ownership
          - 3. Speed is slower than that of a LAN
          - 4. Utilizes fiber optics, satellite links, and leased telecommunication lines.
